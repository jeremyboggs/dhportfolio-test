## Introduction

Address potential readers, from Advisory Committee to future employers or colleagues. Introduce yourself and offer a brief narrative telling the story of your research interests and development as a person working with digital tools as well as other methods of your disciplines. You may write particular reflections on methods as part of

## Projects

Body of Portfolio: Exhibit all the DH projects that you’ve worked or collaborated on, including in course assignments (though as noted, the latter are not counted as Practicum hours). 

### The Practicum:

a. An image and access in some form to the project (a link to the project website or GitHub page) and a brief description of the project and its significance.
b. The student’s contribution to the project, and links to any blog posts you may have written about the project.

### Coursework Projects

Whether solo or collaborative, that relate to DH. Include a. and b. as stated for 1 in the Body of the Portfolio.

### Any relevant written work

For instance a researched seminar paper, that you wish to post rather than to publish with a journal (which would entail copyright). That said, you may decide that some of the projects you list should be simply described in words; these might include projects that you are not a leading collaborator for (it is not yours to “publish”), or preliminary plans for projects not yet prototyped.
