## Introduction

Address potential readers, from Advisory Committee to future employers or colleagues. Introduce yourself and offer a brief narrative telling the story of your research interests and development as a person working with digital tools as well as other methods of your disciplines. You may write particular reflections on methods as part of

## Projects

Body of Portfolio: Exhibit all the DH projects that you’ve worked or collaborated on, including in course assignments (though as noted, the latter are not counted as Practicum hours). 

### The Practicum:

a. An image and access in some form to the project (a link to the project website or GitHub page) and a brief description of the project and its significance.
b. The student’s contribution to the project, and links to any blog posts you may have written about the project.

### Coursework Projects

Whether solo or collaborative, that relate to DH. Include a. and b. as stated for 1 in the Body of the Portfolio.

### Any relevant written work

For instance a researched seminar paper, that you wish to post rather than to publish with a journal (which would entail copyright). That said, you may decide that some of the projects you list should be simply described in words; these might include projects that you are not a leading collaborator for (it is not yours to “publish”), or preliminary plans for projects not yet prototyped.


## DH Dossier

Documentation of the requirements fulfilled for the Certificate. Clearly guide the Advisory Committee members evaluating your portfolio as to how you completed the timeline you planned. It may be a clearly-linked page shared on the public portfolio site, but we assume that your general portfolio audience is less concerned with how you fulfilled the requirements for this certificate. This document should include:

- a statement certifying that he or she has completed all 60 practicum hours required for the Certificate;
- a breakdown of how many of the 60 practicum hours were spent on each project;
- list of courses taken: core, two electives
- evidence of the student’s contribution and involvement in the DH projects that count toward their practicum hours (we can consider a statement by a supervisor; images, examples of work done); [note that this can be a summary and refer to more substantial account (like a final report) shared in the public portfolio]
- brief descriptions and evidence of any other DH projects that the student completed through their coursework (NB: projects completed as part of a DH course do not count toward the 60 practicum hours but may be more fully represented in the public portfolio and summarized in the dossier)
- brief reflections on DH colloquia and other community events (including DH courses taught and DH conferences attended) in which the student participated during their graduate tenure at UVA; include dates, names of speakers if any, the topic or title, some response to the issues or methods
- any relevant reflective writing or scholarly work that you do not wish to present on the public website. For instance, you may have written a response paper for the core course that articulates your own views about an issue or method in digital humanities
